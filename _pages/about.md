I’m Jiayi Yuan (袁加熠, [dʒa-ˈi:]), a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) advised by Dr. [Xia “Ben” Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). My research interest is efficient machine learning, along with its applications in computer vision, natural language processing and healthcare.

Previously, I received my bachelor’s in computer science from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I lived in Beijing for 22 years and in Houston for $YEAR - 2022 year(s).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
