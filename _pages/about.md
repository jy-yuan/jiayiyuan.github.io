### About me

I’m Jiayi Yuan ([dʒa-ˈi:], 袁加熠), a Ph.D. student from the Department of [Computer Science at Rice University](https://cs.rice.edu/), advised by Dr. [Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). My research interests include **efficient and trustworthy machine learning**, and its applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and health informatics. Recently, I'm focusing on **large language models (LLMs)**.

Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I also studied statistics as a minor.

I lived in Beijing for 22 years and in Houston for ``$YEAR-2022`` year~~(~~s~~)~~.
